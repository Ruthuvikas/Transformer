# Transformer

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of core Transformer functionalities and optimization techniques. It focuses on building and understanding Transformer models, including key concepts like self-attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while providing practical implementations for educational and experimental purposes.

## Key Features

- **Self-Attention Implementation**: A detailed implementation of the self-attention mechanism, a key component of the Transformer architecture.
- **Model Optimization with LoRA**: Demonstrates how to optimize Transformers using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), a method to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained models.
- **Customizable PyTorch Code**: All implementations are in PyTorch, making them easy to extend, experiment with, and adapt to other use cases.

## Files in the Repository

- `self_attention.ipynb`: A notebook containing the implementation and explanation of the self-attention mechanism from scratch.
- `LORA.ipynb`: A notebook demonstrating how to use LoRA for optimizing Transformer models.
- `Model_optimization.ipynb`: An exploration of techniques to optimize Transformer models for better performance and efficiency.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
